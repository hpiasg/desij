Refactoring to Integers for Signals.
 - save intermediate STGs for mpsat with numbers instead of signal names


Cache for preset tree calculation:
 remove 'em or implement as 'two level cache', i.e. split cached sets and cache these halfs.
 
Preset trees are still binary, change this, runtime?

Install better graphviz version



Benchmarks: CSC-Aware with repeated Contraction

Implement: Using reachability analysis for redundant places, etc.
Implement: Safe contractions
Implement: Dynamic signature checking for bisimulation calculation


------
 DONE
------

Implement: After repeated contraction, check CSC again, seems to be unnecessary
Implement: Command line option for repeated contraction
