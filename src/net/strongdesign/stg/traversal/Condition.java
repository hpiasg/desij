 * 
 * <p>
 * 
 * Interface for checking a condition for an element of a Petri net
 * e.g. if a transition is activated.
 * 
 * In implementing classes, it might be neccessary to implement a constructor to
 * check_ specific conditions, others might be static and will be provided by a 
 * factory class.
 * 
 * It is assumed that {@link #becauseOf()} is called after a successful call of {@link #fulfilled(T)}
 * 
 * @see stg.traversal.STGOperations
 * @see stg.condition.ConditionFactory
